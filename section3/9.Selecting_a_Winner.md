# 73. Selecting a Winner
我们已经获取了一个相对随机的大数
1. So it's not truly random and it's something that can be kind of predicted ahead of time.
2. We're not going to actually deploy or use this in a very serious fashion just because this function right here really can't be trusted.
3. We can use it to randomly pick a winner out of our players array.
4. So how are we going to use a really large number right here to randomly pick a player.

## 通过大数获取随机数

1.  call the random function that you and I just created to return a large number
2. use the modulo operator, the modulo operator (取模)works in the exact same way that does in Javascript. 10%3 = 1
3. So we get to like so we can use this property to get us an index of the winner inside of our players array.

        uint index = random() % players.length;
