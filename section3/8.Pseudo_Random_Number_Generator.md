# 72.Pseudo Random Number Generator
1. The manager of the contract should then be able to call the pick winner function.
2. The goal of this function is to randomly pick a winner out of a list of players.
3. 随机选出一个，但是solidity中没有随机数。实现的也是理论上的，可以作弊的。
4. However with solidity we do not get access to a random number generator.
5. 要用 a pseudo random number generator by pseudo random That means that it's really not quite random and that our system for picking a winner can actually be theoretically gamed.
6. It is tough to do a random number at random number generators.
7. 


## a pseudo random generator

1. We're going to take the current block difficulty.
   *  it takes some amount of time to process a actual transaction that amount of time that it takes to pick or solve a block or close out a block is referred to as the block difficulty. So this is in theory a large number.
2. We're going to take this really big hexadecimal number(十六进制) right here and then use that to pick our Random winner.
3. the current block difficulty the current time and the addresses of players to some degree is known ahead of time whenever someone wants to pick a winner.

### 选择赢家时候已经知道的
1. We kind of know what the current time is like if you and I send the transaction in to pick a winner
2. in our contract you and I could in theory have a reasonable idea as to what the current time will be when this function is executed.
3. We also know ahead of time the address of the players and we probably also know the current block difficulty.
4. So if we know these three sources of you know what we are calling randomness then it's really not truly random at all.
5. you want to try to design your contracts to not include the idea of randomness at all.
6. 有一些方法来解决随机问题


## random 方法
1. So we want our current block difficulty the current time and the addresses of our players.
2. We're going to feed them into the SHA3 three algorithm.

### sha3/Keccak-256 是个全局变量
[Keccak-256](https://nashmiao.github.io/crypto-world/2019/05/18/hash-in-blockchain/)
[Units and Globally Available Variables](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.4.21/units-and-global-variables.html)
keccak256/sha3 是一样的
1. You might see keccak256 like so recall that much earlier in the course we mentioned that sha3 and this Haverty pronounce this word right here. 

### block也是全局变量
1. block.difficulty: Difficulty will be a number that indicates how challenging it is going to be to seal or solve the current block


### abi.encodePacked
[单位和全局变量](https://solidity-cn.readthedocs.io/zh/develop/units-and-global-variables.html)

### now 全局变量
