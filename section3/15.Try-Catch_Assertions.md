# 86.Try-Catch Assertions

1. if you send less than point zero one either we want to make sure that we do not allow a person to enter into the contract


## try catch

1. when we use a try catch statement, the javascript interpreter will attempt to run the code inside of the curly braces of the try statement.
2. If this code is executed without error then everything continues along.
3. But if something goes wrong with this line of code right here then the catch statement will be triggered.
4. We can use try catch statements to automatically catch errors that are thrown by asynchronous function calls like the one we have right here.

```javascript
describe('lottery contract', () => {
	it('deploy a contract', () => {
		// assert 判断传入的信息是否存在
		//console.log('inbox.options.address', inbox.options.address)
		assert.ok(lottery.options.address);
	})


	// 测试钱不足的情况，会抛出异常
	it('requires a minimun amount of ether to enter', async () => {
		try {
			await lottery.methods.enter().send({
				from: accounts[0],
				value: 0
			})
			assert(false); // 如果走到这自动退出，判断是否有error
		} catch(err) {
			// ok 确保有传入参数
			console.log('error', err)
			assert(err)
		}

	})

})
```

# 87. Testing Function Modifiers（其他人调用PickWinner 报错）
I want to make sure that if someone other than the manager attempts to call pick winner， error should be thrown.
```javascript
	it('only manager can call pickWinner', async() => {
		try {
			await lottory.methods.pickWinner().send({
				from: accounts[1], // 不是manager
			})
			assert(false); 
		//It's entire purpose is to just say if we get to this line of code automatically fail the tests no matter what
		} catch(err) {
			assert(err);
		} 

	})

```

# 88. End to End Test

1. I think we need to write a test that runs through our contract from start to finish.
2. So something that attempts to enter a player into the contract and then attempts to pick a winner and
3. we should verify that the winner receives some amount of money.
4. And we should also verify that the player's array gets completely reset and emptied out.
5. We're going to instead only entering one player to a contract.
6. So we'll always know that that one player will be the winner when we call pick winner of course.
   

## web3.eth.getBalance
1. This is a function that will return the amount of ether in units of wei that a given account controls
2. this function can be used with either accounts that are owned by people like you and me which we refer to as external accounts.
3. It can be also used to retrieve the balance of contract accounts as well.
4. So essentially you throw out any address you want into this function and that will return the amount of ether that is assigned to that address.


## 前后ether	对比
因为有gas消耗，所以比较大概相等
1. And you might be thinking that the difference between these two balance right here is going to be exactly 2 ether
2. However unfortunately for you and me it is not， so any time we send a transaction into
the network. We have to pay some amount of money in gas to get that transaction to be
processed by the network
3. So the difference between final balance and initial balance is going to be into e slightly less than 2 either 
4. So rather than trying to factor in the exact amount of either we spent on gas we can say that well final balance an initial balance should be basically have a difference of slightly less than two either.
5. But honestly 1.8 is pretty much good enough to verify that. Yeah we received some amount of money back when we called the peak winter function.

```javascript
	it('sends money tothe winner and resets the players array', async() => {
		await lottery.methods.enter().send({
			from: accounts[0],
			value: web3.utils.toWei('2', 'ether')
		})
		// 现在减少了1ether
		const initialBalance = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0]);

		await lottery.methods.pickWinner().send({
			from: accounts[0]
		})

		//pickWinner 后又转了回来
		const finialBalance = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0]);

		const difference = finialBalance - initialBalance;
		//We just want to make sure that the difference here is somewhere in around of 
		//close to 2 but slightly less than 2.
		console.log('difference', difference); // 1999953602000011300
		assert(difference > web3.utils.toWei('1.8', 'ether'));

	})
```
