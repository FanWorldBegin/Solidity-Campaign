# 76. Requiring Managers

保证只有manager可以确定赢家
1. we want to make sure that only this manager is able to pick a winner or to call the function to to pick a winner
2. random function 是相对随机的
3. So if some stranger realized that if they called pick winner at just the right time that would influence the values of these three elements right here. They could potentially make sure that a given player won.
4. So in short we want to make sure that only the manager is able to call that pick winner or function

## 判断调用着是否是manager
Manager like so with this line of code we should be able to enforce that nobody can call pick winner except for the person who originally created the contract. In other words the manager.
```javascript
	function pickWinner() public {
			//调用函数的是manager
			require(msg.sender == manager)
			// 获取
			uint index = random() % players.length;
			// send winner balance
			players[index].transfer(address(this).balance);
			
			//创建一个动态数组 ，初始化初始化长度为0
			//players = new address payable[](5); [0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000...]
			players = new address payable[](0);
	}
```

# 77. Function Modifiers
[函数修饰器](https://solidity-cn.readthedocs.io/zh/develop/contracts.html?highlight=modifier#modifier)
使用 修饰器modifier 可以轻松改变函数的行为。 例如，它们可以在执行函数之前自动检查某个条件。 修饰器modifier 是合约的可继承属性， 并可能被派生合约覆盖。
```javascript

contract owned {
    function owned() public { owner = msg.sender; }
    address owner;

    // 这个合约只定义一个修饰器，但并未使用： 它将会在派生合约中用到。
    // 修饰器所修饰的函数体会被插入到特殊符号 _; 的位置。
    // 这意味着如果是 owner 调用这个函数，则函数会被执行，否则会抛出异常。
    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }
}
```
## 取消此轮游戏
将ether送回到发出人账户

1. And the purpose of this function right here was to loop through all the money that we had been sent inside the contract and send it back to whoever had sent it in.
2. 只有manager可以call
3. require(msg.sender == manager); 这样造成了代码重复

### modifier

1. When we use the modifier key word we are defining a new function modifier to be added to our contract
2. function modifiers are used solely as a means of reducing the amount of code that you and I have to write 
3. we just created a modifier called restricted the name of this modifier is absolutely anything that we want it to be.
4. We place one or more lines of code and then after that we place an underscore in a semi-colon.(._)
5. 调用modifier的函数会将函数体插入._位置
6. So the underscore you can kind of imagine as being like a little target like take out all the code out of that function and stick it in where that underscore is.

```javascript
    function pickWinner() public restricted {
        //调用函数的是manager(the person who deply the contract)
        // 获取
        uint index = random() % players.length;
        // send winner balance
        players[index].transfer(address(this).balance);
        
        //创建一个动态数组 ，初始化初始化长度为0
        //players = new address payable[](5); [0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000...]
        players = new address payable[](0);
    }
    
    modifier restricted() {
        require(msg.sender == manager);
        _;
    }
```
