# 67.Mappings and Structs 映射

## Mappings
1. The key thing to keep in mind about a mapping is that all of the keys have to be the same type and all
2. the values have to be the same type as well.


## Structs

1. a struct is a collection of key value pairs very similar to a mapping
2.  but the values of this one of the values of a struct can have different types.



## 区别
1. The difference here is that we usually use a mapping to represent a collection of things.
2. So we might store a collection of different cars inside of a mapping 
3. or we might store a collection of different houses inside of a mapping.
4. In other words use a struct to represent a singular thing.
5. Use a mapping to represent many things.



## 二维数组
![img](../image/section3/14.png ':size=800')

```javascript
const myArray = {
	[1,2,3],
	[4,5,6],
	[7,8,9]

}
```

1. solidity中可以存储二维数组
2. 但我们不仅仅使用solicity,Eventually we want to pull data out of our contract into the javascript world 
3. so that we can show some data on the screen inside of a web browser or an app or whatever it might be.
4. So the issue here is that we do not yet have the ability to pull a nested dynamic rate from the solidity  world over to the javascript world.
5. So in the javascript world no we can't communicate with solidity. We can not receive a nested dynamic array.
6. 问题不是javascript而是链接javascript和solidity的桥梁
7. So to be clear this is not a limitation of javascript 
8. it's not a limitation of solidity
9. it's a limitation of the bridge between the two languages.
