# 69. Entering the Lottery
[array](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.4/types.html#reference-types)

1. In this lesson in particular we're going to initialize our players very well 
2. and we'll start working on our inter function.


## payable

1. address: Holds a 20 byte value (size of an Ethereum address).
2. address payable: Same as address, but with the additional members transfer and send.

### 转入ether后将用户加入sender
1. So now we should be able to call the payable function and send along some amount of money.
2. Then once they send in money will want to make sure that we add in that person's address to the players array right here.
3. So to add a new entry into the array we want to push the new record in.
4. value中输入想要携带的ether

## 70. Validation with Require Statements
1. 配置environment 为 javascript VM
2. remember this Make sure that it's going to use the network that's running inside of the browser.

## require
require返回falsefunction停止，返回true则继续
1. The function that we're going to call is required require is used for validation.
2. We can pass in some type of boolean expression to this required function.
3. If that boolean expression returns to false then the entire function is immediately exited and no changes
4. If the expression evaluates to true then code inside the function continues to run as usual.
5. So the required function is a great thing to use to make sure that some requirement has been satisfied before allowing the rest of the function to be executed.

## 这里比较的应该是wei
判断参加的人最少send 0.01 ether
当比较ether时候需要换算为wei，可以通过网站进行换算，但是wei 数字过大，可以用ether单位表示，会自动换算
1. So rather than writing out this big number we can write out simply point zero one space and then either.
2. Like so when we write out if they're right there then this number will get automatically converted into the appropriate amount of way.
