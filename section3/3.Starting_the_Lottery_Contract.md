# 64.Starting the Lottery Contract

## public and private

1. visibility can be either public or private 
2. using public or private  enforces no security whatsoever over the data inside of your contract
3.  using public or private is much more about making it clear to other developers whether or not they should be able to easily access this variable


## constructor
1. there is one function that gets automatically called whenever we create a new instance of a contract and that is the constructor function.
2.  we need to somehow update this manager variable Whenever someone makes a lottery contract.
3.  搞清楚谁创建了这个合约，并获取他们的地址赋值给message


## the global variable msg
每次调用函数都会包含一个全局变量，msg 包含了谁发送了交易，交易的信息，任何方法中都可以获取

1. any time that we want to invoke a function or in this case create a new instance of a contract.
2. We have an account.
3. We create a transaction and we send it into the network
4. that's what creates our contract instance
5. the global variable that we're going to be using is referred to as the message object or msg for short.
6. it that describe both who just sent in a transaction to the network 
7. and it also describes some details about the transaction itself.

### data
1. the data property includes in the case of contract creation.
2. The contract source code and if we're trying to just invoke a function or send the transaction to a function 
3. then this will contain some of the arguments that we're trying to send to that function.

### gas
1. It also has a gas property which is the amount of gas that we have available to us to run some bit of code.


### sender
This is the address of the person or the account who just sent in a transaction or a call to the network.

### value
交易中包含ether
If a transaction is being sent in with some amount of ether tied to it then the value property contains the amount of ether that has been sent in.


## Remix 中
if I click on the manager button that will retrieve the value that is assigned to the manager variable.

manager	获取到的值 是remix中选择的account的值
