# 75. Resetting Contract State
1. 现在在选择winner后给他转账，然后就没有操作了。
In an ideal world we might try to reset our contract so we run another round of the lottery immediately after picking a winner
2. 希望可以自动循环

## 重设
清空players array

1. When we pick a winner if we empty out our list of addresses 
2. we can then essentially reset the state of our contract back to how it was first deployed.
3. So by emptying out the list of players we can reset the state of our contract and automatically get it ready for another round without you and me having to redeploy the contract.
4. So what we really want to do is just empty out the player's array.

```javascript
	players = new address payable[](5); //[0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000...]
	players = new address payable[](0);
```

1. Now where are these 0x0000 coming from.
2. Well remember it's an array of typed address. So every value inside of your must be of type address
3. If we attempt to create a length of 5 without having any actual values inside there the values will be defaulted to zero and 
4. zero address is what you see right here essentially zero x and then a bunch of zeroes after it.
5. We definitely want to start off with an empty threat which is why we are going to use 0 right here.
6. So that is going to give us an array with absolutely no elements initialized inside of it.

```javascript
function pickWinner() public {
		// 获取
		uint index = random() % players.length;
		// send winner balance
		players[index].transfer(address(this).balance);
		
		//创建一个动态数组 ，初始化初始化长度为0
		//players = new address payable[](5); [0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000...]
		players = new address payable[](0);
}
```
