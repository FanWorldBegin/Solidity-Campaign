1. the next contract we're going to work on is going to be a lottery of sorts or kind of like a raffle.
2. We're going to create a contract that we're going to call a lottery.
3. It will have a price pool and a list of people who have entered for the prize pool.
4. So let's imagine that we have two players player one in player two over here.
5. These two players can send in some amount of money to our contract as soon as someone sends money into the contract.
6. They will then be recorded as a player in the game.
7. the ether that they send into the contract will be held in a prize pool of sorts 
8. at some point in time after some number of people have entered the contract or entered the contest.

4. The contracts will look at its list of participants it will pick one of these two players right here
5. and it will send all of the money out of the prize pool to that particular winner.
