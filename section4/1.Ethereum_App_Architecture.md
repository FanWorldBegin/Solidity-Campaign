1. the theory application running inside the browser will make use of Web 3 which communicates with a meta-mask to creates a transaction.
2. Signs it with the user's private key and sends that transaction to the theory network.
3.  the only way for a user to change data is through the use of their public and private keys.
4.  Remember any time user changes data they have to send a transaction to the network and that costs some amount of money.
5.  the user's machine the public and private keys will never ever under any circumstance be sent to your server.

1. So are we going to say who the manager of the contract is.
2. Notice that it's going to be the managers address
3. state the number of people who have entered the contract.
4. And also how much money is currently inside of the prize pool.
5. Remember that the pick winner function can be only invoked by the manager of the contract.
6. going to have a little status text area.
7. So for example after clicking on the pick winner button right here we might show the address of the person who won or something similar.
8. Now the last thing I want to remind you about here is that in this course we're going to be using the Rinkeby test network for just about everything from here on out.

## 初始化
1. npx create-react-app lottery-react
2. npm install --save web3

meta mask 会自动在浏览器中注入web3,提供provider指向Rinkeby
1. We have meta mask running inside of our Chrome browser.
2.  when ever meta mask is running inside of your browser. It automatically injects the web 3 library into any active page.
3. If I open up my console and type in  web3, 可以看到打印web3
4. into our page has a provider already set up inside of it and you will recall that provider is what allows us to communicate to some given theorie network this provider, in this case points to the Rinkby test network.
5. So whenever we visit a web page with metal mask installed we instantly get access to a copy of web 3, that points to the ring to the test network.

### 注入的web3 (2020已经不在自动注入)
> As of Q1 2020, MetaMask has officially stopped injecting Web3.js, and has updated the
> way you access the current provider. Here’s how to make sure your dApp doesn’t break,
> and how to make it more compatible with the rest of the ecosystem.
