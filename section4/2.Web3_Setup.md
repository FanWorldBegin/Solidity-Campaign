# 93. Web3 Setup
[meta-mask API](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/#new-dapp-developers)
1. We're not going to flip on over to our code editor and write some code that is going to set up our own local instance of web 3.
2. And this is what is going to allow our instance of web 3 to automatically connect to the test network and make use of all of the accounts that have been assigned to the metal mask extension.

## web3.js
This file is going to house all of our configuration code around the web three library.

[参考文档](https://awantoch.medium.com/how-to-connect-web3-js-to-metamask-in-2020-fee2b2edf58a)
> The gist of the changes is basically that providers like MetaMask and Status must 
> continue to inject window.ethereum, but now the window.ethereum object itself is a
> provider type that supports the methods defined in EIP-1102 and EIP-1193. No more
> having to check window.web3 for its currentProvider — we can simply use window.ethereum
> as the provider itself!


```javascript
const Web3 = require("web3");
const ethEnabled = () => {
  if (window.ethereum) {
    window.web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
    window.ethereum.enable();
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```


>Super clean! Essentially, we check if the window.ethereum exists, then create a
>window.web3 object with our own provided version of web3, using the window.ethereum
object as the input provider 

>Once again, the window.ethereum.enable() function calls the pop-up UI dialogue that asks
the user’s permission to connect the dApp to MetaMask.

>In this case, your dApp is now compatible with any EIP-1102 and EIP-1193 compliant
Ethereum provider, making it accessible to many more potential users, and doesn’t lock your dApp into one provider.

>Initializing the dApp can now output a slightly different message when you can’t detect a provider:

```javascript
if (!ethEnabled()) {
  alert("Please install an Ethereum-compatible browser or extension like MetaMask to use this dApp!");
}
```

## window.ethereum
> MetaMask injects a global API into websites visited by its users at window.ethereum. This API allows websites to request users' Ethereum accounts, read data from blockchains the user is connected to, and suggest that the user sign messages and transactions. The presence of the provider object indicates an Ethereum user.

### web3.js
```javascript

const Web3 = require("web3");
var web3;
if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {
	 web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
	window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })
} else {
	console.log('MetaMask is installed!');
}

export default web3;

/**
 * So now any other file inside of our application can require or import this web 3. js file and it will
 * get this pre-built already configured a 100 percent setup version of web 3.
 * */


```

### contract.js
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import web3 from './web3'
class Contract extends React.Component {

	render() {
		console.log(web3)
		return (
			<React.Fragment>
				contract component
    	</React.Fragment>
		);
	}
 }
 export default Contract;
```

### 获取账户

```javascript
	render() {
		web3.eth.getAccounts().then(console.log)
		return (
			<React.Fragment>
				contract component
    	</React.Fragment>
		);
	}
```
