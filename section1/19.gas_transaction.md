#  10.Gas and Transactions
[视频](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/lecture/9020438#overview)
the gas system in theory in the gas system is meant to measure how much work we are executing with our code.

##  gas price and gasLimit
![img](../image/section1/33.png ':size=600')

whenever we issue a transaction that is meant to modify the block chain in any fashion or run any code we have to specify two properties inside of our transaction object.

1. **first property is gas price:** This is the amount of weight or the amount of money that we are offering per unit of gas.
2. start gas: This reflects the total number of units of gas that we are willing to spend with this transaction. here is to say we are willing to accept to pay at most this many units
  
## 示例

1. So that means we are willing to spend 300 wei for every unit of gas
2. we are willing to spend at most 10 units of gas.

如图总共需要14gas，但我们最高可接受的数量为10，执行到6后，后面就不会执行了。

## 助记词

If you write them down on a piece of paper to solve this issue the people in the world have invented the concept of a 12 word pneumonic a 12 word mnemonic allows us to automatically generate a series of



![img](../image/section1/37.png ':size=600')

1. Now the idea behind these new this twelver mnemonic right here is that we can feed these 12 words into a pneumonic algorithm.

2. When we feed them into this algorithm it will spit out a series of different accounts each of which have their own public key private key and address.

3. So rather than having to memorize all of these different keys right here you can only memorize the 12 word pneumonic.


## meta mask 
生成新的助记词，需要重新安装
1. with many mask as it stands right now. We cannot on the fly generate a new pneumonic when we first installed mega-mosque and created a new series of accounts or a new pneumonic that was pretty much it.
2. And if you want to generate a new pneumonic you have to re-install the entire extension so the extension
