# 4.Basic Blockchains

You know most of them are not really going to start with four zeros like that but this one happens to and because it was totally arbitrarily I'm going to say that **this block is signed.**

[SHA256 哈希](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/)

And that's where this nonce comes in.

This is just a number that you can set to try to find a number that fit so that this hash starts with four 0000

## 添加data
hash 不再以0000开头，点击 mine计算出一个 nonce使hash变为以0000开头

## blockchain
So you can see that each block points backwards to the one before it.
And you remember that the first block over here there actually is no previous So it's just a bunch of zeros. It's actually just a fake number.

## 修改其中一个chain 的data
需要把和他相连的都修改重新mine，如何知道block chain 被remind了

## Distributed

[事例](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/distributed)

## tokens

目前Well we have a problem here in this version of the block chain. We don't actually know if Darci has $25.

## coinbase

So that's a basic block chain and we're running a currency on top of it.
