1. Solidity中合约的含义就是一组代码（它的 函数 )和数据（它的 状态 ），它们位于以太坊区块链的一个特定地址上。
2. 代码行 uint storedData; 声明一个类型为 uint (256位无符号整数）的状态变量，叫做 storedData
3. 于以太坊来说，上述的合约就是拥有合约（owning contract）。在这种情况下，函数 set 和 get 可以用来变更或取出变量的值

## deploy our contract
1. Instead we want to use javascript VM by selecting javascript V.N. right there that tells the remix tool

2. that we want to attempt to deploy our contract to that in browser virtual theory and network.
3. value is used to make a transaction and also send along some amount of ether with the transaction will use this value setting later on as we start to test some of our other contracts.

## change any data
![img](../image/section1/28.png ':size=600')
1. Anytime we want to change any data that gets stored on the block chain we are going to have to submit a transaction.

2. And what's more. Not only do we have to submit that transaction but we also have to wait for it to be mined or to go  through that proof of work algorithm and that can take anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds to execute.


##  invoke (调用) functions 
![img](../image/section1/29.png ':size=600')

### There are two ways in which we invoke functions that belong to our contracts.

1. Calling a function can return data as we just saw one second ago. When we call a function it runs instantly because it doesn't involve a transaction it doesn't need to be mined
2. a transaction to our contract instance that targets a specific function. When we do this we can modify a contract's data.


### transaction

1. First any time that we submit a transaction to the network it takes time to be processed. So any time we are trying to update a value any time on any contract it's going to take somewhere from 15 to 30 seconds to actually execute and give us a notification back that says hey everything looks

2. Secondly whenever we send a transaction to a function that returns the transaction hash Szilard call that right here we see right here here's your transaction ID.


## wei

So whenever you see the term wei, we are talking about a small unit of either a very small unit of ether.
