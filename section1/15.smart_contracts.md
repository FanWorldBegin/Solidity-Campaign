1. account:  this record the amount of either that is controlled by this account.
2. You can imagine it being like a tiny little cubby where we can store some data that is related to our contract. This data is related to whatever application we're trying to build. So it can be numbers it can be strings that can be arrays any type of data that is relevant to the application
3. code: This contains all the raw machine code for our contract so very machine level code is almost impossible. for you and I to read very easily you know actually I should say completely impossible.The code that you and I write on inside of our code editors are going to be compiled down to this raw machine code and it's stored inside the contract to count.
