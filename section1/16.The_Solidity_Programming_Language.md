# 7. The Solidity Programming Language

We're going to use a programming language called solidity solidity was invented specifically for authoring

##  how solidity is used.

1. When you and I write a contract we're going to write what is called a contract definition using solidity.
2. Solidity is in actual programming language that is very easy for you and I to read and interact with and understand.
3. But it's not the actual code that is actually executed on the ethereal network inside of these smart contracts.
  
### solidity compiler
1. Instead we're going to take that contract definition and feed it into a solidity compiler.
2. This compiler is going to spit out two separate files.

### byte code
1. The first one is going to contain some byte code and this is the actual byte code that will be deployed to the theory network.So this is the actual stuff that gets stuffed into our contract account.

### application binary interface
the application binary interface which we are going to refer to as the API.

Throughout this entire course this API right here is really key for writing applications that can interact with these deployed smart contracts.

## 示例

1. After we deploy contract and didn't KBI out of it, we're going to eventually write some javascript code that will service kind of the front end or the actual user interface to our contract

2. but our javascript code has no ability whatsoever to interact with the bytecode that has actually been deployed on the theory block chain.
3. Remember that if 3M block chain they smart a contract that exists there.
It contains some byte code that was previously solidity.
4. So you can think of the API right here as being an interface of sorts for getting our javascript code to understand exactly what's going on with this really strange crazy looking byte code down here
