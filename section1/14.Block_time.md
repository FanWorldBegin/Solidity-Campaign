# 5. Block Time

We can think of the hash as being a number.

Now Andreas had specifically said that we are looking for a hash that starts off with some number of

zeroes.

Again that's not entirely correct what we are really looking for is a hash that is less than some target

value.

So 0 0 0 7 to 7 might be less than some target value that our algorithm is looking for.

So he is correct that we are kind of looking for a hash that starts with some number of leading zeros.

But in reality we're actually looking at the value of the hash rather than just a specific number of


## hash长度64
So another way of looking at this is to imagine the entire range of possible hash values the hashes

that we are working with are 64 characters long.

So right here this is 64 characters right here.

it can range all the way from all zeroes which would represent a base 10 value of 10.

Or it could be all F's which in hexadecimal would end up as being something like 1.1 five times ten



So the entire process of rehashing the data along with the incrementing non-SS takes some amount of time.

Our computers can execute many many many hashes per second. Like thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of hashes per second.

However in the real block chain we are looking for some target values or these kind of like comparison

value right here that's less than 1000.


We are looking for some very small target values. So that means that in practice even though our computers can hash all this data very quickly we have to execute so many hashes.

We eventually find that random number that is less than the target value that it ends up taking many

seconds of time in the real world.

## 定义
We refer to the amount of time that it takes to hash everything from zero to the target non-SS value as something called block time.


## 时间花费

The at theory network has a target to block time of 15 seconds.

So ideally in a perfect world to calculate one block it would only take 15 seconds of time and then the network would move on to calculating the next block or the next set of transactions to be executed.

But in practice that is entirely variable.

因为保持在线的计算机数量，计算能力是变化的，所以要调整所算数据的大小保证数据可以被算出来

This is a fantastic little chart that shows you the average amount of time that is taken to calculate

these blocks.
