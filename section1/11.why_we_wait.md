# 3.Why we wait

So the transaction goes out to the network and then we wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

## sent 
 we send that transaction to one particular node once there is a diagram
 of the node the node has an entire copy of the block chain.

So maybe there is in total three transactions that are coming into this node at the exact same time

this node is going to take those transactions which I've now represented here as t representing our

transaction and 0 representing other people's transactions and assembles all three those transactions

## 花费时间
![logo](../image/section1/8.png ':size=600')
I've now represented here as t representing our

transaction and 0 representing other people's transactions and assembles all three those transactions

into one list of transactions which we refer to as a block the node then run some validation logic on

this block that validation logic is what takes the 30 seconds the validation logic is what takes so

long to get a response back to us and say Yup looks like everything actually moved along okay.

## mining
Bitcoin and in theory you've probably heard the term mining mining.

So when these transactions right here get assembled into the block the node starts running some calculations

on the block.

And that process is referred to as mining.
