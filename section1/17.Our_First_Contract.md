### SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
the source code is licensed under the GPL version 3.0. Machine-readable license specifiers are important in a setting where publishing the source code is the default.

### pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.8.0;
 the source code is written for Solidity version 0.4.16, or a newer version of the language up to, but not including version 0.8.0. This is to ensure that the contract is not compilable with a new (breaking) compiler version, where it could behave differently.

### contract SimpleStorage 
A contract in the sense of Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. 

### uint storedData;
declares a state variable called storedData of type uint (unsigned integer of 256 bits). 

### address public minter;
declares a state variable of type address. The address type is  160-bit value that does anot allow any arithmetic operations. It is suitable for storing addresses of contracts, or a hash of the public half of a keypair belonging to external accounts.
### set/get
set and get that can be used to modify or retrieve the value of the variable.

### public
The keyword public automatically generates a function that allows you to access the current value of the state variable from outside of the contract. 

### constructor
The constructor is a special function that is executed during the creation of the contract and cannot be called afterwards.

### msg
The msg variable (together with tx and block) is a special global variable that contains properties which allow access to the blockchain. msg.sender is always the address where the current (external) function call came from.
* msg.data (bytes calldata): complete calldata
* msg.sender (address payable): sender of the message (current call)
* msg.sig (bytes4): first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier)
* msg.value (uint): number of wei sent with the message
