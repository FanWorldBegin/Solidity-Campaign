# 116. Voting System Requirements

1. we start to develop our voting system 
2. Number one is that we should be able to make sure that a single contributor cannot vote multiple times on these single spending request.（一个投资者对于一个请求只能投票一次）
3. big requirement number two is that we should make sure that whenever voting system we
come up with it should be resilient for, if we have many many many different contributors or many different of different contributors or approvers tied to it. (支持很多很多的投资者)


## 错误的方法(执行代码是需要话费gas的)

1. So here's one way that we might start to lay out some data inside of our contract to address the fact that we want to have many people voting.
2. address [] 是投资人的数组，在request struct 中创建另一个数组，存储投票的人信息，当有人投票时候在array中寻找address是否已经存在。


### 代码
![img](../image/section5/16.png ':size=600')

1. 判断用户是否已经投资
2. 判断request中是否已经有此人的地址


### 错误的原因

* 假设第一个判断是否已经投资的操作消耗10000gas
* So in total this for loop costs 10000 gas for every person who has donated to our contract or to our campaign.
* 假设第二个判断是否已经投票的操作消耗5000gas
*  So the entire for loop down here costs 5000 gas for every person who has already voted on this particular request

1. So in total for one contributor one person doing this entire function costs 15000 gas.
2. We've spoken about gas and we've said that it's the cost that it takes to execute some lines of code in out contract.
3. Remember the other requirement was that we should have a voting system that allows for many thousands of contributors inside a single campaign.(很多人很多人投票)
4. So as soon as we start to get a very popular campaign maybe with 10000 people we might be having to spend a tremendous amount of money in order to call that a request function.
5. 所以这样的逻辑是不好的, 随着人数的增加，执行时的gas会越来越贵，所以不能循环数组。
6. 所以 request [] 是不好的
7.  we use a slightly different data structure that doesn't require us to iterate through every record and side there to say See (使用不需要循环的数据结构)
8.  if someone has contributed already or see if someone has donated to our camp.
