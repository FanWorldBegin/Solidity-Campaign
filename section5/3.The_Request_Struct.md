# 111.The Request Struct

1. a Manger is going to call the Create request function and that should create a new spending request.
2. this request variable was going to be an array that holds a list of individual requests.

## struct
1. So we're going to create a new struct inside of our contract that is going to be called a request.
2. Struct types are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library.
3. To define a Struct, you must use the struct keyword. The struct keyword defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract test {
   struct Book { 
      string title;
      string author;
      uint book_id;
   }
   Book book;

   function setBook() public {
      book = Book('Learn Java', 'TP', 1);
   }
   function getBookId() public view returns (uint) {
      return book.book_id;
   }
```

1. any time a manager wants to create a new request they're going to essentially be creating a new instance of the struct.
2. we ever want to make use of it we have to first create an instance of it

## 变量与struct的区别
```javascript
contract Campaign {
    // public private
    address payable public manager;
    uint public minimumContribution;
    address payable[] public approvers;
    
    struct Request {
        string description; //注意是分号
        uint value;
        address  recipient;
        bool complete;
    }
    
```


### 变量
1. These variables right. You're instantly created a local or instance variable tied to the contract.
2. So when we said hey this thing's going to have an address called manager then
3. we suddenly got this variable that we can get access to from all of our functions anywhere in the contract.

### struct
1. However a struct that we define right here is a struct definition. So this does not create an instance of a request
2. 不能直接在函数中直接使用Request = ... 结构体仅定义了一个类型
3. When we eventually want to make a request we will create a new variable and we will specify that its type is request.
4. 可以有很多的Request
