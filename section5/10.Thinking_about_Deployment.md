# 128. Thinking about Deployment

![img](../image/section5/28.png ':size=600')

1. how we're going to take this one single campaign and somehow replicate it up to thirty six thousand times.
2. we're going to talk about some of the different approaches and methodologies that we can use to handle deploying this one singular contract right here multiple times before we start that discussion.
3. whenever we deploy contract ,we are deploying a instance of it to the network in this case maybe the Rinkbey blocked chain or  to the Rinkbey network
4. for every single instance of a contract that you and I deploy. We get back one very unique address.
5. The thing to keep in mind here is that each of these addresses are completely divorced and separate from each other.
6. In other words if we deploy two instances of the campaign contract there is absolutely no linkage no connection between them whatsoever.
7. So if I want to show my users a list of these four campaigns that means that after deploying each of these contracts I need to write down this address I need to record it
8. and then anytime I want to show people information about these contracts I need to go and retrieve information from each of these respective addresses
  
## 项目结构

![img](../image/section5/29.png ':size=600')

1. whenever a user comes to our product. I want them to see a listing of all the different campaigns 
2. and like we just said each of these campaigns，will be coming from a very different address.
3. every time we do a campaign we have to record the resulting address.
4. 项目中用户会发起不同的合约 （create Campaign), 每次新创建一个合约我们需要去记录合约地址


### 方法一
点击 create Campaign 后

![img](../image/section5/30.png ':size=600')

1. 发布一个新的实例，获取到实例的地址，展示在屏幕上
2.  we take our contract source code and we send it down to the user's browser.
3.  Then inside the user's browser We could use a combination of web 3 and met a mask to deploy a new instance of our contract 
4.  when the user deploys this contract from their browser. They will get back an address
5.  so after the user deploys the contract they take that address and they send it back to us.
6.  So they send it like maybe back to our server or something that you and I control.
7.  We then take that address and we publish it very publicly on our site as a brand new campaign.

### 存在安全问题

![img](../image/section5/31.png ':size=600')

1. we have a very malicious user
2.  when this user clicks on create campaign we send the user our contract source code but then user modifies the contract source code in some fashion.(用户修改了源码)
3.  For example maybe they remove the entire approvals system or the entire request system.
4. anytime we send our user the contract source code and then have them deploy it we are essentially putting our fate in their hands. （如果把源码发给用户让用户去发布他们会有可能去修改）
5. So it sure seems to me that we do not want to allow our users to ever get ahold of our contract source code。
6.  we don't want to trust our users in having deployed a correct version of our contract.



## 方法二
1.  clicks on this button. create campaign 
2.  server or like your account my account will be used to deploy a brand new campaign
3.  and then we merely take that address and you and I are 100 percent confident that we have just deployed


### 问题

![img](../image/section5/32.png ':size=600')
1. remember any single time we create an instance of a contract or any time we deploy a contract it costs some amount of money.
2. 部署合约是要花钱的
3.  we get dramatically increase security. However we also are going to pay for it severely if a user comes along and clicks on this create campaign
4.  

##  Solution to Deployment （最好的方法）

![img](../image/section5/33.png ':size=600')

1. a hybrid approach that takes the best qualities of solution number one and solution number two and combines them together.
2. So this time around before we ever really release our application into the wild where people can make use of it we you and I are going to deploy a second contract
3. we're going to write a second contract and we're going to deploy it before we ever release our application. Out to the wild.
4. This second contract that you and I are going to make is going to be a manager of sorts 
5. that's going to manage all the different instances of campaigns that eventually get deployed to the rim to be network
6.  we're going to refer to the second contract as a factory of sorts.
7.  The purpose of this factory is to create new instances of our campaign.
8.  use  a contract to deploy another contract.  we can take one contract and have it deploy another.(用一个合约去部署另一个合约)


### 另一个合约

1. 作用 create and deploy instances of the campaign.
2. If the user clicks on the Create campaign button right here 
3. we are going to tell that users copy of web 3 and meta mask to send the transaction to this campaign factory that you and I are going to put together.
4. When ever one contract deploys another the cost of deployment is on the user who sends the transaction.（用户会付钱）
5. the deployment is being handled by our new factory contract. Yes but the actual payment for that is going to be on the user.
6.  then our factory will deploy a new copy of the campaign 
7. the campaign factory will also be used to store a list of all the different campaigns that have been deployed.
8. this is where we can have one central location that gives us a canonical list of addresses of all the deployed campaigns.
9.  the campaign factory 会控制部署campagin合约，也会管理所有不同的实例
10.  it doesn't have a lot of control but at least keeps a record of what instances of campaign have been deployed 

## 发布工厂
![img](../image/section5/34.png ':size=800')

1. 我们会自己部署这个 campaign factory contract，只需要部署一次可以控制不同的campaigns实例
2. The factory contract itself is going to contain all of the source code for an individual campaign.
3. So the factory has a canonical clean and spoiled version of the campaign source code.
4. So there's absolutely no chance of someone getting in here and rewriting the contract or modifying it in any way shape or form.
5. a user might want to create a new campaign that user is going to send a transaction to the factory and that transaction is going to include some amount of money to pay for the deployment.
6. The factory will take that money. It will create a new instance of a campaign using the store campaign source code that has right here
7. it will deploy a new campaign to the Rinkeby block chain. get a brand new address
8. The factory will then take that address record it and store it within the factory contract itself.
9. So the factory always has a list of all the different campaigns that have been deployed.
10. when our Kickstarter platform wants to get a list of all the different campaigns that have ever been created 
11. we can issue a simple query to the factory and the factory will return a list of all the different addresses that it contains.


## campaignFactory Contract

![img](../image/section5/35.png ':size=600')

### deployedCampaigns
going to be an array of addresses that contains all of the deployed campaigns that have ever been created.

### createCampaign
this is going to deploy a new instance of an individual campaign and then store the resulting address back inside of the deployed campaigns array.

### getDeployedCampaigns
return all the data inside of deployed campaigns.


## 编写Factory

1. 注意再初始化合约的时候需要在contructor 中传入最小值


[new Campaign(minium) 返回的不是address](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54320320/how-to-call-contract-inside-another-contarct-in-solidity-version-0-5-2)

[Getting the address of a contract deployed by another contract
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42230532/getting-the-address-of-a-contract-deployed-by-another-contract)


```javascript
 
 contract CampaignFactory {
     Campaign [] public deployedCampaigns; // 已经发布的地址数组
     
     function creatreCampaign(uint minium) public {
         //  creates a new contract that gets deployed to the block chain 
        Campaign newCampaign = new Campaign(minium);
        
        deployedCampaigns.push(newCampaign);
         
     }
     
 }
```


## 发送人也要修改
1. whenever we have one contract build another 
2. the message variable the message global variable inside campaign will be the campaign factory not the user who's trying to make this thing.
3. 所以要声明用户的address


```javascript
    constructor(uint minimum) {
        //  the sender property describes exactly who is attempting to create the contract.
        manager = msg.sender;
        minimumContribution = minimum;
    }
```


## 测试
1. 使用factory发布实例后粘贴地址到address 
2. 选择campaign contract 
3. 点击at Address,就能与已经发布的contract进行交互
4. So remix allows you not only to create new contracts on the fly but you can also have it kind of interact with already deployed contracts as well.
