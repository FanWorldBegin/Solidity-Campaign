# 111. More on Function Modifiers

1. We're now going to start working on the Create request function right here and we're also going to create our requests array
2. We're going to make an array that specifically holds variables of type request.
3. 生成一个请求，并加入请求列表
4. 仅有manager可以生成request


## modifiers
```javascript
	modifier restricted() {
			require(msg.sender == manager); // 确保只有manager可以操作
			_;
	}
```

# 112. Creating Struct Instances

## createRequest

>The purpose of the Create request function is to create a new struct of type request and
then add it to the request array.

```javascript
  function createRequest(string calldata description, uint value, address recipient) public restricted {
        
        Request memory newRequest = Request({
            description: description,
            value: value,
            recipient: recipient,
            complete: false
        });
        requests.push(newRequest);
    }
```

1. we create a new request we have to place every different property that the request is going to be initialized with.全部变量都要声明
