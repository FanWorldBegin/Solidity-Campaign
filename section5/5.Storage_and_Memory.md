# 114. Storage and Memory
![img](../image/section5/8.png ':size=600')

##  1. how our contract stores data.


### storage and meomry
![img](../image/section5/9.png ':size=600')

1. storage is used to hold data between function calls.(所有函数都可以访问,长久存储)
2. memory can be thought of as a very temporary place to store data. (暂时存储)
3. storage is all about preserving data memory is about very temporary data.


函数参数为memory data

```javascript
constructor(uint minimum) {
		//  the sender property describes exactly who is attempting to create the contract.
		manager = msg.sender;
		minimumContribution = minimum;
}
```

1. When our function is called it is given some arguments 
2. and then when the function is complete and exits those arguments are essentially lost to the void (函数完成就无法再获取)
3. and we have no ability to go back and reference those arguments again.


## how solidity variables store values

### 声明为Storage
![img](../image/section5/10.png ':size=400')

在函数中声明myArray, warning 提示添加 keyword storage

![img](../image/section5/11.png ':size=600')

1. keyword storage changes how myArray works when we use the keyword storage.
2. It makes tmyArray point directly at the exact same location that the numbers variable is pointing at. (myArray 指向了numbers指向的存储地址)
3. 设置myArray[0] = 1; 会直接修改numbers数组的内容，numbers[0] 值为 1 而不是20.

### 声明为memory 
![img](../image/section5/12.png ':size=600')
1. if we use memory some additional step is going to come into play.
2. if we use mrmory,  we would take the numbers array. solidity would make a copy of it.nd place it into memory inside of our contract. （会将storage中 numbers数组复制一份放入memory中.
3. Remember memory gets dumped any time a function exits.
4.  myArray would no longer point out the array inside of storage.
5.  Instead as you might guess it's going to point to this new copy sitting over in memory
6.  numbers[0] 值为20

## 为什么要区分storage 和 memory
1. 设置changeArray函数，在Numbers函数中调用，将numbers作为参数传入函数，在changeArray中修改，再次获取numbers[0]为20，没有被改变，传入的是copy,而不是numbers本身, myArray 是 numbers的copy
2. 参数被默认指定为memory,默认认为操作是copy 也可以显式声明
3. 修改为storage， 当操作myArray 相当于修改numbers，此时numbers[0] 值为1.
  
```javascript
function changeArray(int[] memory myArray) private {
	myArray[0] = 1;
}
```
```javascript
function changeArray(int[] storage myArray) private {
	myArray[0] = 1;
}
```

>What that means is that whenever we pass a value into a function like this we are actually making a copy of that array.

>Whenever you take in function arguments they are automatically assumed to be memory type variables.

## 结构中的声明

1. All new requests can do is attempt to refer to this new value that exists inside of memory.
2. So we have to use the key word here memory like so
   

```javascript

    function createRequest(string calldata description, uint value, address recipient) public restricted {
        
        Request memory newRequest = Request({
            description: description,
            value: value,
            recipient: recipient,
            complete: false
        });
        requests.push(newRequest);
    }
    
    
}

```
