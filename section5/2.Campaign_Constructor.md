## 发送ether payable修饰
Any time someone is going to send some money. We need to mark the corresponding function as being payable.

### payable
1. So payable right here is what makes this function able to receive some amount of money.

### require
2. So at the top of the function we'll add in a required statement to look at the amount of money that
3. this user is sending and make sure that it is greater than the minimum contribution we'll say require

campaign.sol

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <=0.8.0;

/** 
 * @title Ballot
 * @dev Implements voting process along with vote delegation
 */

contract Campaign {
    // public private
    address payable public manager;
    uint public minimumContribution;
    address payable[] public approvers;
    
    constructor(uint minimum) {
        //  the sender property describes exactly who is attempting to create the contract.
        manager = msg.sender;
        minimumContribution = minimum;
    }
    
    //So payable right here is what makes this function able to receive some amount of money.
    function contribute() public payable {
        //判断是否满足最低标准
        require(msg.value > minimumContribution);
        approvers.push(msg.sender);
        
    }
}
