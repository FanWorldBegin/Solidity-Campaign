# 1.Contract_Deployment
it's not enough just to edit this thing inside remix. We need to figure out how we can actually deploy the contract.

## how to deploy

Now we've got Remax.  Here's our contract source but how do we actually deploy it for deployment.

![img](../image/section2/2.png ':size=600')

1. That source is going to be placed into the slot the compiler.
2. Just so you know this compiler is running inside the remix tool right now.
3. The slitty compiler is going to spit out both an API and the contract bytecode and this bytecode right here is what actually ends up getting deployed to some network.


## Truffle

There is a very common tool that you're going to see mentioned and a tremendous amount of documentation
![img](../image/section2/3.png ':size=600')

1. truffle is kind of a one stop shop for development of theory in contracts.


2. It's a command line tool that we can use to aid in contract creation. So like actually writing out source code and doing some local testing So programmatic automated testing

3. So like actually writing out source code and doing some local testing So programmatic automated testing to make sure that our contract behaves the way we want it is also useful for deployment as well.


## Truffle缺点

![img](../image/section2/4.png ':size=600')
1. Some things about truffle don't really work well like some functionality in this truffle tool is a little bit rough around the edges.

2. Other things don't work at all. So truffle has some features that you would really expect it to have but they don't actually work.


3. The dependencies that we are using are going to break sometimes they don't function well.

## 不使用工具
1. So for this first project that you and I are going to put together in order to deploy our inbox contract code right here to the actual Rinka the network or to any network whatsoever rather than using truffle or any other fancy tools 

2. you and I are going to put together a custom node project from scratch that's going to aid us in contract creation in doing some local testing and actually doing deployment to the Rinka the network.
3. So there are tools out there to automate this process and make it very easy to get set up and started.
4. So I want you to understand what these tools are doing behind the scenes.
5. So you and I are going to build our own custom boiler plate that is going to aid in all of these common tasks.
