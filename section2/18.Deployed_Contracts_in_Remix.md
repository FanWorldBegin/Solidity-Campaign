复制我们的源码到remix

1. We've been using remix up to this point to run our code on a test local network that exists only inside the browser.
2. However remix can also be used to connect to actually Theertham networks and interact with deployed contracts.

### environment
选择 injected web3 metaMask 注入的扩展可以直接连接到我们的账户
1. environment we're going to want to open up this dropdown and select injected web three injected
2.  injected web3 is an instance of web 3 that has been injected into this web page by the meta-mask extension.
3.  So this is a version of web 3 that has already been configured to not only connect to the Rinkby test networ
4.  but it also has direct access to all of our accounts.

看到提示页面弹出 当前操作要花钱
1. We are now attempting to submit a transaction to the rink B test network to modify some data that exists in the contract.
2. Remember that is an operation that costs money.
3. So we are spending either just to update the data inside of our contract 
4. whenever we attempt to send some money through one of our accounts tied to get a mask.
5. We get this a masked notification and it says hey the current web page that you are on is attemp to use some money out of your account.
