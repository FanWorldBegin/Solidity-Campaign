# 2.Boilerplate requirement
![img](../image/section2/6.png ':size=600')

We're going to need to set up that solidity compiler and remember we've been saying that the solidity compiler spits out an API that we use to work with javascript and the actual byte code which is what it gets deployed to the network.


## Moka
In order to set up a testing pipeline inside of our project we're going to be making use of the Moka test library.

Moka is a very generic and general testing library that gets used with all types of javascript projects


## 初始化项目

1. npm init

### 1. contracts
1. The first folder that we're going to create is called contracts.
2. This contracts directory will contain the raw source code for each of the contracts that we end up building.
3. .sol means that this file right here is going to contain some solidity code.
   
### test
This is going to contain one file that's going to be testing the inbox contract using some Moka code that you and I are going to write the in-box test file right here is going to be where we spend the vast majority of time with this first project that we're working on.

### package.json
The package saw some file will behave in the same way so we're going to create some number of scripts inside of it and it's also going to record different dependencies that we install into our project.

### compile.js
this will be a small script file whose sole purpose will be to look inside that contracts directory and compile each of the contracts that exist inside of it.

So this is going to be kind of a one off project file or a one off file that is used solely to compile our code.

### deploy.js
And then finally we have deployed. Yes this is also going to be a little script file whose sole purpose will be to take some compiled code and deploy it to a theory network that might be the main network or Roberston or ring B or even a private local network as well.
