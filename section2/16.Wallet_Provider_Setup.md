## 功能

![img](../image/section2/21.png ':size=600')

## the provider
1. is how our web 3 instance talks to some particular network.
2. We just installed a special provider that allows us to not only connect to some outside API or some outside node but it also allows us to simultaneously unlock an account.


### ganache provider
```javascript
// 创建实例 链接到local test network
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());
```

1. ganache provider and that instantly allowed us to connect to this local test network and also unlocked a couple of accounts for us this time around.

### new provider
1. We have to set up this provider manually.
2. when we set up the provider we need to specify exactly what network we want to connect to.
3. And we also need to use it to somehow unlock an account that will be used for all the different deployment requests that we make.
4. So that's why we are installing this module the truffle HD wallet provider
5. It's going to allow us to connect to the Rinka the network hosted through Fura and it's going to simultaneously.
6. And more importantly allow us to very easily unlock and account to use.


## 创建deploy.js
```javascript

const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
const Web3 = require("web3");
const { abi, evm } = require('./compile');

```
### HDWalletProvider
1. it's going to simultaneously specify which account or which account we want to unlock and use as a source of ether for deploying our contract.
2. And it's also going to specify what outside API or what outside node we are going to connect to.


### 创建provider 传入web3

```javascript
const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
const Web3 = require("web3");
const { abi, evm } = require('./compile');
//MetaMask
const mnemonicPhrase = "alert auction keen brave paddle gravity orbit arrest weekend cabin lift bachelor";
let provider = new HDWalletProvider({
  mnemonic: {
    phrase: mnemonicPhrase
	},
	// 我们需要连接的网络 infura
  providerOrUrl: "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/04fed318ed0c4f44bbd699674cfdde38"
});

//It's going to pass it to the Web through the constructor and we're going to get out in the instance of web3
const web3 = new Web3(provider);

```

1. Now this instance of Webber 3 right here is completely enabled for the Rinka the network we have unlocked in account.
2. So we have a source of ether and we have specified what network the web 3 instance needs to connect to.
3. So we can use this three instance to interact with the test network in any way or shape or form we want.
