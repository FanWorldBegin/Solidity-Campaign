# 53. deployment with Infura

1. Compile it and then deploy it to a real test network. And that's kind of conflicting when I say that real tests not work.
2. we're going to deploy to Rinkby but we could just as easily deploy this to the main network.
3. We're only using Rinkby be because remember we have to pay real money to deploy our contracts.
4. Once you learn how to deploy a contract to Rinka be it's the exact same process to deploy it to a main network.


## Local test network and real network
1. But there's going to be just a little bit of added difficulty because you and I need to kind of understandexactly what is different between 
2. deploying to a local test network where all of our accounts are unlocked
3. and open for access versus a real network where we have to somehow get an account that has some amount of ether in it already.


## concept of the web 3 instance

1. The first thing I want to do here is remind you about the concept of the web 3 instance and the provider.
2. So we've got an instance of web 3 which is our portal to all things occurring in the world 
3. and a web3 instance doesn't operate on its own.
4. We have to set a provider on the instance which is how web 3 communicates with some given network.
5. So again you can imagine that this provider kind of gets inserted into this web 3 instance like so.

1. So we're going to start off at the right hand side and talk about what is similar about deployment to a public test network and what is dissimilar.
2. So just as before we're going to use a web 3 instance to facilitate our deployment process
3. we're going to create the instance we're going to shove a provider into it 
4. and that provider is going to tell our nstance exactly what network is supposed to be communicating with.


## 本地网络和公网区别
1. big difference is the fact that this time around we have to make sure that we are using an account that has some ether on this test network or on the Rinkby network.


### 以前的流程 使用Gnanch生成的虚拟账户
1. So before we just said hey take some account there was pre-generated for us some account 
2. that is already unlocked on our ganache local network and just go ahead do the deploy and you and I didnt have to worry anything about security or private keys or public keys or anything like that.

### 真正的账户
1. But this time around again we're using a real account here.
2. We're going to spend some kind of fake but also kind of real either to do this deployment.
3. So this time around our provider needs to have an account that it's going to use as a source of ether for the deployment.
4. To do that we're going to take what's called our account new Monnick the account mnemonic.

### account mnemonic（助记词）
1. the account mnemonic. Was that 12 word phrase that was provided to us by mega-mosque when we first created our account a while ago
2. So that account mnemonic is kind of a stand in not only for your public key but also the private key and just a little bit.
3. But essentially that mnemonic can be used to unlock your account and use the ethers within it to deploy a contract.
4. So we're going to take that account pneumonic and pass it to this provider that you and I are going to create 

### Ganache account
1. Previously we used a provider that was given to us directly by Ganache.
2. And so that provider already had some of those accounts or this account information kind of installed inside the provider.

### 不再使用自动生成的account
1. So the big difference here is that this time around we don't get those automatically created accounts included in the provider.
2. We have to set that thing up ourselves.

## 另一个区别
1. Now the next big difference is that once we start up tempting to deploy to the Rinku the network 
2. we need to make sure that we have some node that we can connect to to actually deploy our contract.
3. Remember whenever we think of the Rinkeby the network it's not just this one singular box says I've kind of depicted it here that we are connecting to.
4.  we have to connect to a node that exists inside the ring the network.
5. One of the common solutions you'll see around this is to run a local node on your own machine.
6. so a real ethereal node that connects to the rink the network and you can then use that node running on your machine to deploy your contract.

### 本地奖励node太麻烦
1. However that's a process that takes a lot of time and a lot of difficulty to set up.
2. So rather than using a local full theory mode which would take us a lot of time and a lot of effort
3. we are instead going to use a service called inFira 
4. inFura is a public API that we can sign up for.
5. It gives us the ability to get access to a node that is hosted on the rink network by an Fura
6. essentially think of an InFura as being our portal beyond web 3 into the ring to the network.
7. The company that runs this Yura API also has nodes that are available on the main network on Roberston on Kovan.
