# 54 Infura Signup

1. Remember Infura is just going to give us access to the Rinkeby network.
2. It does not replace the need for signing up for it in a theory account or creating one on our own and getting that public and private key.
3. In addition Infura does not manage your ether tokens your coins anything like that.
4. It is solely our connection point to the outside Rinkby network.
5. If we were not making use of Infura, we would have to host our own node on our local machine which as I had said is a real pain in the neck.
