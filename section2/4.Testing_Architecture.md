# 4.测试环境依赖安装
Remember the goal behind testing these contracts can work with a lot of money.

So we need to make sure that they are working that in the way that we design them.

That's the entire goal of testing a contract.

## 1.编译流程
![img](../image/section2/8.png ':size=600')
Remember we take our contract. We put it into the compiler and we get out the API and the byte code.

## 2.test 流程
![img](../image/section2/10.png ':size=600')

1. We've got our solidity compiler which is going to spit out our byte code and our KBI you and I are going to take this byte code and we're going to deploy our contract to a local test a theory and network this local test network right here is going to be running on our own personal laptop or desktop.
2. Our local test network is going to be created by a library called gosh. You'll notice I have labeled this as both can wash and test our PC.
   
### Ganache
1. This library this local test network that we're going to use is was previously called test our PC. So that's the old name of this library. More recently test our PC was renamed as Ganache 



## 依赖安装

### web3
npm install web3
[文档](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0/)

## test/Inbox.test.js
```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const ganache = require("ganache-core");
const Web3 = require('web3')
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());


```
### 1. assert
assert 模块提供了一组断言函数，用于验证不变量。[文档](http://nodejs.cn/api/assert.html)

### 2. Web3
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider()); 构造函数
1. Whenever we make use of Web 3 we are always going to be requiring in or importing a constructor function.
2. So this right here is a constructor. It is used to create instances of the web 3 library 
3. by tradition or by convention I should say whenever we are working with a constructor function we always capitalize it.

1. Web 3 is used as the absolute end all solution for communicating between a javascript app and the theory network.

2. Remember several times we said that web 3 is kind of like our portal into the theory world.
