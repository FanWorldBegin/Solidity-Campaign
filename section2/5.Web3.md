1. Web 3 is used as the absolute end all solution for communicating between a javascript app and the theory network.
2. Remember several times we said that web 3 is kind of like our portal into the theory world. It's how we get program and programmatic access to a theory and network.



## how web 3 is organized.

1. So right here at the top we have the web 3 constructor function.
2. Textfile we're going to use the constructor to make an instance of web 3.
3. we have created and in particular we have to set up something called a provider.
4. A provider can be thought of as like a communication layer between the web 3 library and some specific theory and network.
5. So the provider right here this is a communication layer.
6. Every provider that we ever make use of for connecting to different networks has a identical set of methods on it.
7. These different methods allow the web free library to essentially send a request over to a local network and to receive a response to that request.


inbox.test.js

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const ganache = require("ganache-core");
const Web3 = require('web3')
// 创建实例 链接到local test network
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());

```

1. We're going to provide ganache.provider like so.

2. So this line of code right here is what creates an instance of web 3 and tells that instance to attempt to connect to this local test network that we are hosting on our machine solely for the purpose of running these tests in the future.
3. So again this first argument right here is going to change over time depending on what network we are attempting to connect to.
