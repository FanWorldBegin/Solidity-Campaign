# 6.testing with Mocha

Moka is a test running framework we can use Moka to test any type of javascript code.

These are the three main functions that we need to be aware of.

![img](../image/section2/13.png ':size=600')

## it function

1. The purpose of it is to run one individual assertion on something that we're trying to test.

2. So this is really the unit of measurement for testing it's the absolute core of testing something

### assertion

1. whenever I say assertion I mean to say that we're going to take two values 
2. one value that our code is produced 
3. and then another value that we think should be equal to that variable 
4. will then compare the two together and make sure that the values that are could produced is
what we were expecting it to be.
5. So we refer to that as an assertion.


## describe function

1. We use describe to group together a collection of it functions 
2. describe is really just organizational in nature 
3. described just helps us grouped together certain functions that are testing the same thing
4. so that when we go and look at those tests in the future or when we look at the output of our testing report we can understand that certain groups of our test are related 

## beforeEach Function


1. before each is really a utility（通用） function that is used to extract some amount of logic that is common to a lot of our tests.
2. So for example if we have multiple IT function calls where we run a test that are all doing some very similar set up logic then we could use a before each function to extract that logic and only write that
code out one time.


## 编写实例
npm install --save-dev mocha

### 编写函数作为测试使用
1. So let's now try writing out a little bit of code with Moka to run some tests over this class right here
2.  and assert that calling park and drive both return stopped and vroom respectively.

inbox.test.js

```javascript
// Mocha测试实例

class Car {
	park() {
		return 'stopped';
	}

	drive() {
		return 'vroom';
	}
}
```

### assert


1. We're going to use that US-CERT library that we had required in earlier the assert library.
2. You will recall is a part of the node standard library and it has a variety of functions tied to it
3. that allow us to make sure that one value is equal to another assert has many other functions that allow us to write effective tests as well 

### inbox.test.js

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const ganache = require("ganache-core");
const Web3 = require('web3')
// 创建实例 链接到local test network
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());


// Mocha测试实例

class Car {
	park() {
		return 'stopped';
	}

	drive() {
		return 'vroom';
	}
}

// 第一个参数可以随意命名，和类名无关
describe('Car', () => {
	it("目的: test park function", ()=> {
		const car = new Car();
		// 判断 car.park() 和 stopped 是否相等
		assert.equal(car.park(), 'stopped')
	})
})
```


## 执行测试
package.json
```json
{
  "name": "inibox",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha"
  },
```

npm run test

![img](../image/section2/14.png ':size=600')


## 多次实例化优化 beforeEach
```javascript
// 第一个参数可以随意命名，和类名无关
describe('Car', () => {
	it("目的: test park function", ()=> {
		const car = new Car();
		// 判断 car.park() 和 stopped 是否相等
		assert.equal(car.park(), 'stopped')
	});

	it("目的: test dirve function", () => {
		const car = new Car();
		// 判断 car.park() 和 run相等
		assert.equal(car.drive(), 'run')
	})
})

```

### 优化

beforeEach 会在每个it 执行前执行
```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const ganache = require("ganache-core");
const Web3 = require('web3')
// 创建实例 链接到local test network
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());


// Mocha测试实例

class Car {
	park() {
		return 'stopped';
	}

	drive() {
		return 'run';
	}
}

const car;
// 会在每个it 前执行
beforeEach(() => {
	car = new Car();
})

// 第一个参数可以随意命名，和类名无关
describe('Car', () => {
	it("目的: test park function", ()=> {
		// const car = new Car();
		// 判断 car.park() 和 stopped 是否相等
		assert.equal(car.park(), 'stopped')
	});

	it("目的: test dirve function", () => {
		// const car = new Car();
		// 判断 car.park() 和 run相等
		assert.equal(car.drive(), 'run')
	})
})
```
