## actual compilation (编译)

1. Remember we're going to pass some contract source code into that compiler
2. and that is going to spit 
out the API which is our javascript interpretation layer of what the contract is 
3. and also the contract byte code which is what we actually deploy off to the theory of network to install the solidity compiler.

## 1. 依赖安装
[solc-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc)

1. npm install --save solc
2. npm install fs-extra
3. npm install ganache-core

## 2. 创建compile.js

### 不可以直接require
```javascript
require('./contracts/Inbox.sol');
```
1. Remember whenever we require a file into a node project the node engine will attempt to execute the contents of the file as though it were Javascript code.

2. So if we attempt to require in the contract file it's going to neatly throw an error saying hey this
isn't javascript code that you're requiring.

3. So rather than attempting to directly require in this file we have to read the contents of the file off of our harddrive to read the contents out.


## 3. 方法引入

### path
The reason we're going to use the path module for this rather than attempting to just write out the path directly is that by using the path module we are guaranteed to get cross platform compatibility.

### __dirname
__dirname name surname is a constant that is defined by node and it always gets set to the current working directory so that will take you from your root directory on your your home directory on your computer

### fs
So we're going to read in the raw source code from our contract to do so we'll create another temporary variable and I'll call this one simply source to read in the contents of the file We're going to use the file system module.


### solc.compile
Compile will pass in our source code and then we also have to specify the number of different contracts
compile.js
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const solc = require('solc');
const fs = require('fs');

const inboxPath = path.resolve(__dirname, "contracts", "Inbox.sol");
const source = fs.readFileSync('inboxPath', 'utf8')

console.log(solc.compile(source, 1))

```

## 4. 运行
node compile.js

根据[最新文档](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js)
参考文档[solc-js: Compiling Ethereum Smart Contracts Locally with JavaScript](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/compiling-ethereum-smart-contracts-locally-0-5-2-0-5-x-ebfea0aed3a9)
compile.js
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const solc = require('solc');
const fs = require('fs-extra')

const inboxPath = path.resolve(__dirname, "contracts", "Inbox.sol");
const source = fs.readFileSync(inboxPath, 'utf8')

// console.log(solc.compile(source, 1))



var input = {
  language: 'Solidity',
  sources: {
    'inbox.sol': {
      content: source
    }
  },
  settings: {
    outputSelection: {
      '*': {
        '*': ['*']
      }
    }
  }
};

var output = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)));
console.log(output)
// `output` here contains the JSON output as specified in the documentation
for (var contractName in output.contracts['inbox.sol']) {
  console.log(
    contractName +
      ': ' +
      output.contracts['inbox.sol'][contractName].evm.bytecode.object
  );
}
module.exports =  output.contracts['inbox.sol'];
```
