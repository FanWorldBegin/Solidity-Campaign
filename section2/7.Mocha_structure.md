# 7.Mocha structure

We're going to first start off by getting a good idea of how we're going to use Moka at all to test that theory.



## 流程
![img](../image/section2/15.png ':size=600')

We're going to repeatedly follow the same cycle that you see here on the screen at the very top.

Moka is going to boot up and Audry automatically load up our Inbox test file and start to execute a

series of tests in there inside that file We're going to go through the same cycle over and over again.


1. The first thing we're going to do is to take our contract byte code and deploy it to our local test network.
2. Remember that is called the ganache local network. This will deploy a new instance of our contract. 
3. We will then write some code to manipulate that contract in some fashion.
4. So maybe we will change the message that is stored inside of it.
5. After that we'll then make an assertion about a value that is tied to the contract.
6. After that is executed we then go back up to the top deploy a fresh new contract and then manipulate the contract in some other fashion. And then again make an assertion about that.
   

## beforeEach
1. we use before each with Moka to do some common initialization or configuration logic.
2. So I think inside of a before each will want to attempt to deploy our new contract then the process
3. So in every case we probably want to manipulate the contract slightly differently.
4. And that means that the actual manipulation should be placed into an IT block that is custom for each testing scenario.
5. And finally we're going to make an assertion about the contract and as we've said several times assertions are always placed inside of our blocks.
6. previously when we were making use of Remax we had said that a contract is created through a transaction.
