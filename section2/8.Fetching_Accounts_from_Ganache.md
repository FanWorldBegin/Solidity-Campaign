# .45 Fetching Accounts from Ganache

1. we're going to make access to Web 3 and use it to retrieve a list of accounts that are automatically created for us as a part of this local network.
2. Remember we can only deploy contract when we have access to an account.

1. we're going to use web 3 to access this list of unlocked accounts that are created automatically for us by ganache these accounts are defaulted as being unlocked.
2. We're 100 percent accessible just to make our lives for testing a lot easier.
3. When we say unlocked accounts remember it just means that we can freely send or receive either from these accounts without any concern over private keys or security or anything like that again is just to make our lives easier.


## web3.eth
[web3.eth](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0/web3-eth.html)


1. every function almost every I almost want to say every function I think every function that we call with three is asynchronous in nature and that means that it's always going to be returning a promise.


### web3.eth.getAccounts 获取账号
npm run text

inbox.test.js
```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const ganache = require("ganache-core");
const Web3 = require('web3')
// 创建实例 链接到local test network
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());

beforeEach(() => {
	//Get a list of all account
	// use one of those accounts to deploy the contracts
	web3.eth.getAccounts()
		.then(fetchedAccounts => {
			console.log(fetchedAccounts)
		})
})

describe('Inbox', () => {
	it('deploys a contract', () => {
		
	})
})
```

1. So after our test run you'll see a listing of 10 separate accounts.
2. These are pre-generated accounts that are created by that good notshe local test network automatically
3. all 10 of these accounts are completely unlocked so we can use any of them to deploy contracts to send money to send or to call a function on a contract.
4. Anything we want to do these 10 accounts are created just to make our lives easier
5.  so that we don't have to manually create an account every time that we want to run a test.
6.  Do you remember again that it is solely a local test network.
7.  It's only for executing tests and contracts locally really just for development purposes.


```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const ganache = require("ganache-core");
const Web3 = require('web3')
// 创建实例 链接到local test network
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());

var accounts;
beforeEach(async () => {
	//Get a list of all account
	// use one of those accounts to deploy the contracts
	accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
	
})



describe('Inbox', () => {
	it('deploys a contract', () => {
		console.log(accounts)
	})
})

```
